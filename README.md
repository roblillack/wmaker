# What is this?

Window Maker is a NeXTSTEP-like window manager for the X11 Window System.

This repository tracks the [original sources](https://repo.or.cz/w/wmaker-crm.git)
but adds some of my personal patches on top:

- Adds unicode symbols for modified keys in menus ([#1](https://github.com/roblillack/wmaker/pull/1))
- Use the corrent OPENSTEP background color by default for all widgets ([#2](https://github.com/roblillack/wmaker/pull/2))
- Adds a margin of 3 pixels next to the dock ([#3](https://github.com/roblillack/wmaker/pull/3))
- Fix application menus ([#4](https://github.com/roblillack/wmaker/pull/4))
- Improve appicon scaling algorithm ([#5](https://github.com/roblillack/wmaker/pull/5))

For more information, please check the [original README](./README.orig).
